This Netflix Clone Project is a responsive web application designed to replicate the sleek user interface of Netflix. It dynamically fetches movie data from the TMDb API to display trending movies, genre-based categories, and more. The project includes an interactive FAQ section with smooth toggles, where users can expand or collapse answers with visual transitions between plus and multiplication symbols. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases modern web development techniques while delivering a user-friendly, Netflix-like experience.
